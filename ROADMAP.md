## 💰 Go-To-Market & First Dollar Strategy

### The MVP Is Ready NOW

**What you have today that's monetizable:**
1. **90 FQHC profiles** with verified data no other platform has (funding vulnerability, union status, programs, EHR systems)
2. **156 job listings** with real salary data
3. **Career assessment** that scores candidates on 4 behavioral domains
4. **Resume builder** that generates FQHC-optimized resumes
5. **Displaced worker pipeline** capturing laid-off community health workers
6. **Layoff intelligence** tracking 2,300+ affected workers across 11 organizations

### Who Pays First?

**Most likely first customers: Mid-size FQHCs (200-500 staff) that are actively hiring in hard-to-fill roles.**

Why:
- Too small for recruiting firms (who focus on hospitals and large health systems)
- Too busy to sort through Indeed/ZipRecruiter noise
- Need candidates who already understand FQHC culture, EHR systems, and programs
- Facing imminent funding cliffs — need to hire fast before cuts hit

**Specific targets from your data:**
- FQHCs with `fundingImpactLevel: "high"` that still have active job listings (they need to hire NOW)
- FQHCs hiring for RN, behavioral health, dental (hardest roles to fill)
- FQHCs in regions with recent layoffs (displaced talent pool available nearby)

### GTM Sequence

| Phase | Action | Revenue Model | Timeline |
|-------|--------|---------------|----------|
| **1. Free Value** | You're here. Platform is live, content is strong, SEO is working. | None yet | ✅ Done |
| **2. Outreach** | Email 10-15 HR directors at target FQHCs. Show them the insights dashboard + their FQHC profile. Offer a free "Talent Intelligence Brief" for their region. | None — relationship building | Week 1-2 |
| **3. First Placement** | Use fast-track pipeline to match a displaced worker to a hiring FQHC. Make the intro. Close the placement. | Placement fee ($2-5K) or success fee (10-15% first year salary) | Week 3-6 |
| **4. Talent Drop Pilot** | Offer 3 FQHCs a monthly "Talent Drop" — batch of 5-10 pre-screened, assessed candidates for their open roles. | Subscription ($500-1,500/month) or per-candidate ($200-500/intro) | Month 2-3 |
| **5. Scale** | Formalize pricing. Build employer dashboard. Automate Talent Drops. | Recurring revenue | Month 3-6 |

### What Blocks Revenue?

| Blocker | Impact | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| No employer dashboard | Can't show candidates to employers at scale | Build after first manual placement |
| No auth system | Can't gate premium features | Build after first revenue |
| No Talent Drop workflow | Can't automate batch delivery | Start manual, automate later |
| **Nothing blocks a manual placement** | You have candidates (fast-track pipeline) and you have employers (directory + waitlist) | Pick up the phone |

### The Honest Answer: You Can GTM Today

The platform is an MVP. The content is strong. The data is unique. What's needed isn't more features — it's **10 outbound emails to FQHC HR directors** and **1 successful placement.**

**Recommended first action:** Pick the 5 FQHCs with the most active job listings in your data. Look up their HR director on LinkedIn. Send a personalized email referencing their specific openings and offer to send them 3 pre-screened candidates for free. Close one placement. That's your first dollar.

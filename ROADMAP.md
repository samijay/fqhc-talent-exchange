## 🔨 In Progress (Current Sprint)

### Strategic Pivot: Repositioning Fast-Track & GTM

**Problem:** The "48-hour placement guarantee" on `/fast-track` isn't realistic yet — no employer pipeline to fulfill it. Need to reposition.

**New positioning — For Candidates (Displaced Workers):**
- Lead with **free tools**: Resume Builder, Career Assessment, Career Roadmap, Certifications
- Position as the **#1 aggregator** for FQHC jobs, insights, directory (220 FQHCs, 177+ listings)
- Fast-track becomes a **priority intake** form, not a delivery promise
- Message: "We help you get job-ready — assessment, resume, career plan — all free, all designed for community health"

**New positioning — For FQHCs (Employers facing layoffs):**
- Lead with **layoff support**: "Your workers deserve a soft landing"
- **Free tier:** Offboarding toolkit — resume builder access, career assessment for affected staff, job board aggregation across 220 FQHCs
- **Paid tier 1:** Managed offboarding — we intake your displaced workers, assess them, build their resumes, promote them to hiring FQHCs
- **Paid tier 2:** Placement services — curated matches via The Drop, facilitated intros, follow-up
- Message: "Turn layoffs into transitions. We help your displaced staff land at FQHCs that are hiring."

**Tiered Service Model:**
| Tier | For Candidates | For FQHCs | Price |
|------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| **Free** | Resume builder, assessment, career roadmap, certifications, job board, directory | List in directory, access to candidate pool | $0 |
| **Priority** | Fast-track intake, priority matching, career coaching | Managed offboarding for displaced staff, employer branding | $500-1,500/event |
| **Premium** | The Drop (curated matches, 48h employer response) | Talent Drop (batch of 5-10 pre-screened candidates), dedicated sourcing | $2-5K/placement or subscription |

### Two-Track GTM

#### Track A: Candidate Acquisition (Free — Volume Play)
Position as the **#1 free career platform for community health workers**:
- Resume builder → Career assessment → Career roadmap → Certifications → Job listings
- **For displaced workers:** "Get job-ready in 30 minutes — free resume, free assessment, free career plan"
- **For career changers:** "Discover your path in community health"
- **SEO + content marketing** drives organic traffic; tools convert to waitlist signups
- Every candidate who completes assessment + resume = qualified lead for The Drop

#### Track B: FQHC Revenue (Paid — Tiered Services)

**Lead with layoffs** — FQHCs facing workforce reductions need a partner:

| Tier | Service | Price | Trigger |
|------|---------|-------|---------|
| **Free** | Directory listing, access to candidate pool, self-serve insights | $0 | Any FQHC |
| **Offboarding Lite** | We intake displaced workers, build resumes, assess skills, promote to hiring FQHCs | $500-1,500/event | FQHC announces layoffs |
| **Offboarding Pro** | Managed transition: dedicated support, career coaching, priority matching | $2-5K/event | Larger layoffs (50+ workers) |
| **The Drop** | Monthly batch of 5-10 pre-screened, assessed candidates for open roles | $500-1,500/mo or $200-500/intro | Actively hiring FQHCs |
| **Placement** | Direct placement with success guarantee | 10-15% first-year salary | Hard-to-fill roles (RN, BH, dental) |

**Why this works:**
- **Layoffs create urgency** — FQHCs doing layoffs want to do right by their staff
- **Free tools build trust** — candidates experience value before we pitch employers
- **Data is the moat** — 220 FQHCs, quality scores, labor history, live job counts
- **Offboarding → placement pipeline** — workers we help today become candidates we place tomorrow

### GTM Sequence (Updated)

| Phase | Action | Revenue Model | Timeline |
|-------|--------|---------------|----------|
| **1. Free Value** | Platform live. 220 FQHCs, tools, content, SEO. | None — candidate acquisition | ✅ Done |
| **2. Outreach** | Email 10-15 HR directors. Lead with layoff data + their FQHC profile. Offer free "Talent Intelligence Brief" for their region. | None — relationship building | Week 1-2 |
| **3. Offboarding Pilot** | Partner with 1-2 FQHCs facing layoffs. Offer managed offboarding for displaced staff. | Offboarding fee ($500-1,500) | Week 2-4 |
| **4. First Placement** | Match displaced workers to hiring FQHCs via The Drop or direct placement. | Placement fee ($2-5K) | Week 4-8 |
| **5. Talent Drop Pilot** | Offer 3 hiring FQHCs a monthly Talent Drop. | Subscription ($500-1,500/mo) | Month 2-3 |
| **6. Scale** | Employer dashboard, automated matching, multi-region. | Recurring revenue | Month 3-6 |

### What Blocks Revenue?

| Blocker | Impact | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| ~~Fast-track promises "48 hours"~~ | ~~Sets unrealistic expectations~~ | ✅ Repositioned — free tools + priority intake (shipped #51) |
| No employer dashboard | Can't show candidates at scale | Build after first manual placement |
| No auth system | Can't gate premium features | Build after first revenue |
| **Nothing blocks outreach** | You have data, tools, and content no competitor has | Pick up the phone |

### The Honest Answer

The platform is strong. The data is unique. The tools are real. What's needed is **10 outbound emails to FQHC HR directors** — specifically:
1. FQHCs that just did layoffs (offer offboarding support)
2. FQHCs that are actively hiring (offer The Drop)
3. FQHCs in regions with both layoffs AND hiring (the arbitrage opportunity)

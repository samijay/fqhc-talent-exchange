## Part 7: Key Talking Points for Calls

### When an HR Director Asks "Why Should I Use You?"

1. **"We only do FQHCs."** Unlike Indeed or ZipRecruiter, every candidate on our platform understands Medi-Cal populations, CalAIM programs, and FQHC culture. Zero noise.

2. **"We have displaced workers ready now."** 2,400+ healthcare workers were just laid off in California. Many have FQHC experience. We fast-track them through assessment and resume building in 48 hours.

3. **"We know your data."** We track funding vulnerability for all 90 CA FQHCs. We know which roles are hardest to fill in your region and what your competitors are paying. [Show insights page]

4. **"First intro is free."** Send us your hardest-to-fill role. We'll match 3 candidates. If one works out, great — we'll talk pricing. If not, you've lost nothing.

### When They Ask "How Is This Different From LinkedIn/Indeed?"

- **Candidates are pre-assessed** on 4 behavioral domains specific to community health
- **Resumes are FQHC-optimized** (EHR systems, programs, certifications, bilingual skills)
- **We track the market** — salary benchmarks, funding cliffs, regional demand
- **We work both sides** — we find the candidates AND understand your organization's needs
- **Speed** — 48-hour first intro from our fast-track pipeline

### When They Ask "What Do You Charge?"

"For our first few partner FQHCs, we're keeping it simple. The first intro is free. If a candidate we send gets hired, there's a placement fee of $2,000-5,000 depending on the role. Compared to traditional recruiting firms that charge 20-25% of salary ($15K-$25K for an RN), we're a fraction of the cost because we're building a marketplace, not a traditional agency."

  "about": {
    "title": "About FQHC Talent Exchange",
    "subtitle": "We're on a mission to strengthen California's community health workforce.",
    "heroTitle": "We Exist Because Community Health Workers Deserve Better",
    "heroSubtitle": "When California's Medi-Cal funding cuts displaced thousands of community health workers, we saw an industry failing the very people who hold it together. FQHC Talent Exchange was built to fix that.",
    "problemTitle": "The Problem We're Solving",
    "problemP1": "Federally Qualified Health Centers are the backbone of California's safety-net healthcare system. They serve over 7 million patients — most of them uninsured or on Medi-Cal — across more than 1,400 sites statewide. The people who make these clinics work are community health workers, care coordinators, patient navigators, and outreach specialists who share the language, culture, and lived experience of the communities they serve.",
    "problemP2": "When Medi-Cal funding cuts hit, these workers were the first to go. Not because they weren't essential — but because the programs that funded their positions lost revenue overnight. Meanwhile, other FQHCs across the state are desperately hiring for the exact same roles. The disconnect is staggering: experienced community health workers sitting at home while clinics down the road can't find qualified candidates.",
    "problemP3": "Generic job boards don't solve this. They don't understand FQHC-specific programs like Enhanced Care Management or Community Supports. They don't know that experience with OCHIN Epic is more relevant than experience with Cerner. They don't speak Spanish. And they certainly don't advocate for candidates — they just list jobs and move on.",
    "approachTitle": "Our Approach",
    "approach1Title": "Candidate Advocacy, Not Just Listings",
    "approach1Desc": "Every candidate gets a dedicated advocate who understands their experience, translates their skills into FQHC language, and actively introduces them to hiring organizations. We don't post and pray — we place people.",
    "approach2Title": "Speed That Matches the Crisis",
    "approach2Desc": "Displaced workers can't wait months. Our process delivers first employer introductions within 5 days and targets full placement within 21 days. Every day a qualified worker sits idle is a day patients go underserved.",
    "approach3Title": "Deep FQHC Expertise",
    "approach3Desc": "We understand 330 grants, PPS billing, UDS reporting, and the alphabet soup of revenue-generating programs — ECM, CCM, Community Supports, TCM, BH-ASO. When we match candidates, we match on the competencies that actually matter to FQHCs.",
    "approach4Title": "Always Free for Job Seekers",
    "approach4Desc": "Community health workers should never have to pay to find their next role. Our platform is 100% free for candidates — always. Employers invest in our services because we save them time, money, and the cost of unfilled positions.",
    "serveTitle": "Who We Serve",
    "serveP1": "Our platform serves the community health workforce across California — from community health workers and promotoras to care coordinators, behavioral health specialists, EHR analysts, and clinic leadership. Many of our candidates are bilingual Spanish-English professionals with deep roots in the communities their FQHCs serve.",
    "serveP2": "On the employer side, we work exclusively with Federally Qualified Health Centers and FQHC Look-Alikes. We understand the unique operational realities of community health — from managing multiple funding streams to maintaining UDS benchmarks — because that's all we do.",
    "mattersTitle": "Why This Matters",
    "mattersP1": "When a community health worker gets placed at an FQHC, it's not just a hire — it's a patient who gets connected to Medi-Cal, a family that finds a medical home, a chronic condition that gets managed before it becomes an emergency room visit. Every placement we make has a direct impact on health equity in California's most underserved communities.",
    "mattersP2": "We measure success by placement speed and community impact — not by how many resumes we collect or how much we can charge. If a candidate is better served by a direct referral than our full process, we make that referral. The mission comes first.",
